/*
Execution of a c++ program involves 4 stages using different compiling/execution tool, these tools are a set of programs which help to compile the c++ program's execution process.

>> Preprocessor
>> Compiler
>> Linker
>> Loader

step1: preprocessor

>> first stage of a c++ program's execution process; in this stage the preprocessor processes the program befpre compilation

>> preprocessor include header files, expand the Macros and other constants declared with # sign
--------------------------------------------------
Step2: compiler

>> This is the second stage of any c++ program execution process , in this stage generated output file after prepocessing (with source code) will be passed to the compiler for compilaton

>> Compiler will check the errors and generates the object file (this object file contains assembly code)

--------------------------------------------------
Step3: Linker

>>  This is the third stage of any c++ program execution process, in this stage linker links the more than one object files or libraries and generates the executable file. 

--------------------------------------------------
Step4: Loader

>> This is the final stage of any c++ program execution process, in this stage the loader loads the executable file into the main/primary memory.

>> and program runs
